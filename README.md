# BrigadierDiscord

An experimental library to allow you to use [Mojangs brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier), a command parser & dispatcher designed and developed for Minecraft: Java Edition, for a Discord bot using JDA. 

This project is very early on in development and needs lots of work. Please report issues via GH issues.
